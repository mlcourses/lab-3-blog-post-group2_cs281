# Lab 3: Ramp Circuit

# Overview and Motivation
Welcome to the Lab 03 of CS281: Introduction to Computer Systems! 
This lab will use an analog input to display a number on a 7-segment display. A 7-segment display contains 7 leds that are arranged to form a number.. By the end of this lab, you'll be adept at working with essential circuit components and potentiometer.

# Building the Lab: The Voltage Divider
##  What do we need to know?
First of all, we need to know about hte Voltage Divider!<br>
Voltage divider is a arrangement of resistors configured to create a target voltage. <br>
We will use below equation to calculate the volage current.
<br><img width="400" src="eq1.png">

We will have a constant voltage with 5 volts and the current is inversely proportional to the resistance. <br>
Which means changing the resistance will inversly change the current that bigger the resistance, smaller the current. <br>
<br><img width="400" src="5.png">
<br><img width="400" src="6.png">

In order to finout the voltage of the V in the above picture, we will use below equation since we know the current will be the same across the curcit.
<br><img width="400" src="eq2.png">

Since the voltage of this lab will be 5V, by changing the "R1" and "R2",  we can generate any voltage V that we want between 0 and 5 volts. <br>


Now we need to know that is a "potentiometer". <br>
A potentiomter is a variable resistor that allows us to fine tune our voltage divider. <br>
This means that by using potentiometer, we can vary the value of "R1" and "R2" in a way to change the value of V like the photo below. <br>
The value that is written in the potentiometer means that the sum of "R1" and "R2" is the number (ex 10KΩ).
<br><img width="400" src="4.png">
This is how we will set up the poteniometer!

## 1. Project Step

<br><img width="400" src="3.png"><br>

Let's start building and testing the potentiometer! <br>
We will generate voltage V in a range of 0 to 5 volts using the voltage divider from the potntiometer. <br>
We will use this output signal as a input the the Aruino for "analog input" pin 0 (A0).<br>
<br><img width="400" src="IMG_0341.JPG"><br>
#### Note: Do not forget to GND the wire to the leftmost connection column of the potentiometer and +5V to the rightmost column.
#### Note: Middle connections are all the same and you will wire one of these middle connections for the output of the voltage V. 
#### Note: Make sure the input is pinned to analog input NOT digital pin 0. <br>
<br>
<br><img width="400" src="2.png"> <br>
We will use output pins 11, 12, and 13 to produce a binary signal (pin11 =B0, pin12 = B1, pin13 = B0) based on the potentiometer reading. <br>
These signals will be input to breadboard logic so that we can express numbers in 7-segment display. 
<br><img width="400" src="0.png"><br>
We will try to signal the correct LEDs based on the above chart to display the correct decimal value. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now we will hook up the potentiometer to the Arduino and calibrate. <br>
1. Let's start by connecting the V output of the potentiometer to the A0 pin on the Arduino.
<br><img width="400" src="IMG_0343.JPG"><br>

#### Note: Be sure to connect Arduino to the breadboard vid GND ELSE there will be garbage reading in potentiometer.

<br><img width="400" src="IMG_0347.JPG"><br>
2. We will set up the Arduino program and compile it to write it to the board.
#### Note you will use the bit shifting and masking to get the value that you want for B0, B1, B2

3. Use below code in the Arduino program

#### Note: You may want to calibrate the analog input by changing the number taht you are deviding the paramter val
#### Note: You may use print statement to check the value and make sure pins 11-13 are pouptiing the corresponding binary value for the LEDs
```
const int potpin = 0;
const int WAIT = 1000; // 1 second delay
void setup () {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(11,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(potpin,INPUT);
}
void loop () {
  int val;
  int dval;
  int bitval;
  val = analogRead(potpin);
  dval = val/171; // normalizing factor-->adjust this to get the range you want
  Serial.print("From Pot: ");
  Serial.println(val);
  Serial.print("Decimal Value Conversion: ");
  Serial.println(dval);
  //use bit ops to get each bit!
  bitval = dval & 1;
  digitalWrite(11,bitval); // signal C
  dval = dval >> 1;
  bitval = dval & 1;
  digitalWrite(12,bitval); // signal B
  dval = dval >> 1;
  bitval = dval & 1;
  digitalWrite(13,bitval); // signal A
  delay(WAIT);
}
```

One important thing to note before we begin constructing these circuits is we have a limited number of gates, so it is important to use all the inputs in each gate before using another one. For this, have just one inversion using NOT gates for B0, B1, and B2. These will be denoted with ~B0, ~B1, and ~B2 and will be reused multiple times by attaching another wireing to the respective NOT gate outputs.
<br><img width="400" src="WireAD.jpeg"><br>
### 1. Project Step
LED A is the most complicated circuit out of all the LEDs. This one involves two AND gates and two OR gates, as well as two NOT gates. We can use the 7404 NOT gate, 7408 AND gate, and 7432 OR gate to construct this on the breadboard. This circuit starts by inserting ~B2 and ~B0 as the inputs into the first AND gate. For the second AND gate, this will just take input from B2 and B0 with no inversion. The first OR gate will have its inputs be the outputs of the two AND gates. Then the second OR gate will take in the output of the first OR gate and B1 as inputs. Then wire the second OR gate's output with a resistor into the pin for LED A.


### 2. Testing
<br><img width="200" src="number.png">
<img width="200" src="0.png"><br>
It is best to test as you go with each LED. Using the potentiometer go through each number that will be displayed and check if the correct LED lights up for the correct numbers. For LED A, it should be on for 0, 2, 3, and 5 and off for 1 and 4.

### Example testing
This is the same testing as D.<br

## D LED
### 0 About
<br><img width="400" src="WireAD.jpeg">


 
### 1. Project Step
This one is very simple. Its the same exact circuit as A, therefore you do not need to reconstruct it. You may simply make another output wire from A and connect it to the LED D pin on the 7-segment. Make sure there is at least one resistor before the LED D pin.


### 2. Testing
<br><img width="200" src="number.png">
<img width="200" src="0.png"><br>
Since LED D has the same wiring as LED D, test if they come on at the same time. LED D should be on for 0, 2, 3, and 5 and off for 1 and 4.

### 1. Project Step
This one is slightly different but not hard. The wireing of the LED E pin is the AND of ~B0 and ~B2. This already appears in the wiring of LED A and D. Take attach another wiring to the output of the first AND gate in the LED A and D wiring and wire it with a resistor to the LED E pin.
